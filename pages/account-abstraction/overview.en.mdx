## What you can achieve with Account Abstraction at pier

Account abstraction eliminates the need for users to manage cumbersome seed phrases, making onboarding more user-friendly. Instead, users can leverage familiar sign-in methods such as social logins or username and password combinations, offering an easily recognizable experience. Additionally, the utilization of biometrics for login adds an extra layer of convenience and security. Account abstraction also removes the burden of handling gas fees, allowing businesses to cover transaction costs on behalf of their users. In the event of lost access, new recovery methods such as social recovery and integration with authenticator apps provide reliable and secure alternatives.

Features include:

- Seamless and automated wallet creation, tailored to your products needs. Can be completely invisible if desired or integrated with SSO.
- Configuration of wallet properties (e.g. default guardian, default recovery, whitelisting, etc)
- A paymaster to pay for gas fees on behalf of your users
- Simplified & immediate transaction process without nonce tracking or waiting for confirmations
- Reduced concerns about transaction issues like stuck transactions, gas prices, failures, order, and batching
- Progressive security set up: from no security to advanced security with social recovery, multi-sig or authenticator recovery - tailor it to your user's needs
- After successful implementation, a dashboard gives you a detailed overview of your usage of the pier platform.
