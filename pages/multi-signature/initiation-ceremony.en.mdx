# How initiate a new enterprise grade multi-signature wallet

## To initiate a pier mutli-signature wallet, a few set of information is required:

- A human readable name for the wallet

- The number of transaction signatories
- The number of required signatures for a transaction to be valid
- The public keys & human readable name of the transaction signers

- The number of access right signatories
- The number of required signatures for an access right change to be valid
- The public keys & human readable name of the access right change signers

- Whitelist of addresses that can be used as a destination for a transaction
- A human readable name for each whitelisted address

## Once this informatiuon is gathered off-chain & signed off as part of the implementation project, the wallet can be deployed on-chain:

1. The person destined with an access-right signatory can use pier's UI to set up these parameters
2. He can then validate the parameters & deploy the wallet on-chain
3. Any subseqent changes to the wallet parameters can be done by the access-right signatories directly on-chain with pier's UI
