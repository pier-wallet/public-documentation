## What You Can Achieve with Multi Signature Wallets at Pier

For more intricate setups requiring top-tier security, we offer enhanced features like:

- **Multisig Authorization**: Share authorization across multiple entities. Transactions above a certain value require consent from a specified number of parties.
- **Account Freezing**: Lock the account from an authorized device if a device is lost or compromised.
- **Account Recovery**: Authorize new devices and reset access using pre-approved accounts.
- **Transaction Limits**: Set daily/weekly/monthly limits to safeguard against unauthorized large withdrawals.
- **Whitelists Creation**: Restrict transactions to pre-approved addresses. Whitelists require multiple signatures for modifications, adding an extra layer of security.
