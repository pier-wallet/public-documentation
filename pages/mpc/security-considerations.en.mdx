## Security considerations

- We (pier) are not responsible for storing the user shares & backups - we can only give advice on how this can best be achieved
- We (pier) will not hold "enough" keys for us to be classified as "custodian" or any bad actor to be allowed a transaction - this means for example that we will not hold 2 out of 3, only 1 out of 3
- We (pier) will encrypt key shares - this means that even if someone gets access to our DB, they will not be able to decrypt the key shares
- We (pier) will not hold backup of "old" / "rotated" keyshares
- We (pier) will only allow "authenticated by the user" requests
- We (pier) will allow authentication of users via standard mechanisms - oAuth 2.0 is preferred
