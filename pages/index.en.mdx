# Welcome to pier

At pier, we believe that in the future everyone will have one, if not many, wallets.
We offer a **wallet-as-a-service** platform leveraging **account abstraction** and **Multi Party Computing (MPC)** technology. Our integration is plug & play. We enable a
superior user experience while allowing users and businesses to be **self-custodial**.

## Build it your way

- on **mobile**, **web** or **desktop**
- **as a service** or **on premise**
- with our **pier branded** frontend, **White Labelled** or **your own**
- to allow **Account Abstraction** or **Multi Party Computing (MPC)**
- supporting **Bitcoin**, **Ethereum**, **Polygon**, and many more

## Build on top of tech that makes sense

- [**Account Abstraction**:](/account-abstraction/overview) On all EVM chains (e.g. Ethereum, Polygon), pier Account Abstraction SDK gives you access to all Account Abstraction capabilities - you can create wallets, sign transactions, allow social logins, whitelists, blacklists and many more. Your users will not have to worry about private keys, seed phrases, gas fees or any other blockchain related complexity.

- [**Multi Signature**](/multi-signature/overview): On all EVM chains (e.g. Ethereum, Polygon), you can set up wallets so they allow multiple signatures (n/m) to sign transactions. This is especially useful for companies, DAOs, or any other organisation that wants to have multiple people sign transactions.

- [**Multi Party Computing**](/mpc/overview): On all non-EVM (e.g. Bitcoin, Cardano) chains, pier MPC allows you to create wallets with multiple key shards (n/m) and sign transactions - without your users having to worry about private keys, seed phrases, gas fees or any other blockchain related complexity.
