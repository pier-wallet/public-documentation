# Theory behind Wallets

Blockchain technology predominantly utilizes ECDSA (Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm) for digital signatures, involving a private and a public key.

- **Private Key:** A 32-byte integer, typically represented in hash form.
- **Public Key Generation:** Applying the ECDSA algorithm, specifically **secp256k1** (used by Bitcoin and Ethereum), to the private key generates a corresponding public key.
- **Public Key Representations:**
  - **Full:** A 65-byte long integer.
  - **Compressed:** A 33-byte long integer.
- **Wallet Address:** Created by hashing (using sha-256 or keccak-256) the public key.

The core function of a wallet is to store a **private key**, enabling the signing of messages and submission of signed transactions on a blockchain. It also tracks the digital values associated with its **public address**.

## Theory behind Account Abstraction and Multi-Signature Wallets

Account Abstraction simplifies user interactions on blockchains by treating accounts more like smart contracts. Multi-Signature wallets require multiple keys for authorization, enhancing security.

- **Account Abstraction:**
  - Accounts behave like smart contracts.
  - Simplifies transactions and interactions.
- **Multi-Signature Wallets:**
  - Require multiple signatures for transactions.
  - Provide an added layer of security.

  ðŸ’¡ Account Abstraction represents a shift from traditional key-pair based
  accounts to a more flexible contract-based approach.

## Theory behind MPC (Multi-Party Computation) Wallets

MPC, or Multi-Party Computation, is a method to distribute a private key among multiple parties.

- **Key Sharing:** The private key is divided into shares, encrypted, and distributed.
- **Independent Computation:** Each party computes their share of the key without revealing their portion to others.
- **Decentralized Key Storage:** The private key is never fully formed in a single location.

This approach mitigates the risk of a single point of failure, as seen in traditional wallets where a compromised device could lead to asset theft.

  ðŸ”’ With MPC, hacking a wallet requires breaching multiple, diverse systems
  simultaneously, significantly increasing security.

MPC solutions like MPC-CMP and MPC-GG20 are fast and widely adopted methods for implementing such decentralized key management systems.
